# Violence-and-Lifespan-variation
Violence and lifespan variaiton in Mexico
The first decade of the twenty-first century was marked by the stagnation of Mexican life 
expectancy caused by the unprecedented rise of homicide mortality after 2005 and the burden 
of diabetes mortality. The effect of violence was such that improvements made in other causes of death,
such as birth conditions and respiratory diseases, were whipped out by the rise of homicides,
particularly in males. 
Although these results underscore important consequences of the rise in homicide mortality, 
they mask variation in lifespans, a fundamental inequality between individuals.
Lifespan variation is dimension of public health that has arisen as an important topic since 
it addresses the growing interest in health inequalities and its linkage with health behavior.

Here, we do that.
